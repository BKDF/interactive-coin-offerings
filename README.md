# interactive-coin-offerings
The current repo will house the implementation(s) of the Interactive Coin Offering whitepaper done by Jason and Vitalik.<br/>
The idea is to have a place that houses all the different implementations in the same place so it is easier to co-ordinate or collaborate. Also interested parties will have to look at one place.<br/>
You can choose to host your code here on a sub-folder named after your implementation or just provide a `README.md` with a link to the actual repo the code is hosted on. Also please note that if you choose to host your source code directly on this repo you will have to deal with the inherent technicalities that will arise.<br/>
Participant will get write access to their respective sub-folders.<br/>
Needless to say, different implementations will have different licences. You can choose your own license and add it to your sub-folder.<br/>
