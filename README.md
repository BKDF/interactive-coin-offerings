# interactive-coin-offerings
The current repo will house the implementation(s) of the Interactive Coin Offering whitepaper written by Jason and Vitalik.<br/>
This repo will will promote easy co-ordination and collaboration across all implementations of the Interactive Coin Offering Protocol = ALl interested parties can review in one place.<br/>
You can choose to host your code here on a sub-folder named after your implementation or just provide a `README.md` with a link to the actual repo the code is hosted on. Also please note that if you choose to host your source code directly on this repo you will have to deal with the inherent technicalities that will arise.<br/>
Participants will get write access to their respective sub-folders.<br/>
In the spirit of open-source collaboration and giving back to the community, we recommend all project's utilize the MIT licence.<br/>

An Addendum to the White Paper, Proposed Design Spec, Issues List and initial implementation are expected soon :)
